Finally getting around to setting up a development blog.

Since I think I'll mainly be blogging about stuff I do in various [GitHub repos](https://github.com/rmg),
it only seems natural to use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). Conveniently, that
pretty much decided for me that I'll be using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
